### Project Description
SkillUp is a college-focused peer learning and collaboration platform designed to help students connect, share knowledge, and solve doubts in a structured digital environment.
The platform enables students to interact through a clean, ChatGPT-style interface where they can participate in discussions and contribute to academic conversations. One of the core features of SkillUp is its anonymous doubt system, which allows students to ask questions without revealing their identity. This encourages open communication, especially for students who hesitate to ask questions publicly.
Students can:
Create an account and log in securely
Participate in real-time style discussions
Post anonymous academic doubts
Reply to doubts and help peers
View structured conversation threads
SkillUp is built using modern web technologies including React (Vite) for frontend and Supabase for backend and database management, ensuring a fast, scalable, and cloud-connected experience.

### The Problem statement
Students hesitate to ask doubts publicly due to fear of judgment.
Many academic questions remain unanswered in classrooms.
No safe anonymous platform to ask “basic” or “simple” doubts.
No centralized digital space dedicated to peer-to-peer learning inside colleges.
Students with strong skills (coding, design, math, etc.) have no proper platform to share their knowledge.
Other students don’t know who to approach to learn specific skills.
Skill sharing happens informally and inconsistently.
Introverted students struggle to participate in classroom learning.
Lack of collaboration across departments and academic levels.

### The Solution
SkillUp acts as a centralized digital academic hub exclusively for college students to discuss, share, and collaborate.
By observing discussions and replies, students can identify knowledgeable peers and connect for learning support.
SkillUp provides an Anonymous Doubt System, allowing students to ask questions without revealing their identity.
Anonymous posting + digital interface encourages equal participation without social pressure.
SkillUp builds a growing database of doubts, answers, and discussions that future students can refer to.
SkillUp solves hesitation, unstructured communication, and lack of peer skill-sharing by creating a centralized, anonymous, and collaborative academic platform for college students.

## Features

List the key features of your project:
1️⃣ Share / Offer Skill
The Share or Offer Skill feature allows students to list the skills they are proficient in, such as coding, graphic design, mathematics, electronics, or communication skills.
By offering their expertise, students can help others who want to learn those skills. This creates a peer-driven learning ecosystem where knowledge is shared within the college community instead of depending only on external courses or paid platforms.
This feature encourages:
Peer mentoring
Collaborative learning
Recognition of student talent
Stronger academic networking
2️⃣ Explore Skill
The Explore Skill feature allows students to browse available skills offered by their peers.
Instead of searching randomly for help, students can:
Discover who offers specific skills
Identify potential mentors
Connect with skilled peers
Learn new technologies or subjects
This makes skill discovery structured and accessible, helping students grow beyond classroom learning.
3️⃣ Anonymous Doubt System
The Anonymous Doubt feature allows students to post academic or technical questions without revealing their identity.
This removes hesitation, fear of judgment, and social pressure. Students who are shy or unsure about asking questions in public can participate confidently.
Other students can reply to the doubt, creating a structured discussion thread that remains stored in the system for future reference.
This promotes:
Inclusive participation
Honest academic discussion
Increased doubt resolution
4️⃣ Credits System
The Credits System acts as a motivational mechanism within the platform.
Students can earn credits by:
Offering skills
Helping others
Answering doubts
Contributing meaningful replies
Credits can represent reputation, contribution level, or academic involvement within the platform.
This system encourages active participation, healthy competition, and consistent knowledge sharing among students.
